The topics at the end of the semester (null spaces, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) are not in our textbook. This is a resource for those topics.

### Some free online linear algebra textbooks.

* [A First Course in Linear Algebra](http://linear.pugetsound.edu/html/fcla.html) by Robert A. Beezer

* [Linear Algebra](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/linear-guest.pdf) by David Cherney, Tom Denton, Rohit Thomas, and Andrew Waldron
  
* [Linear Algebra](https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/) by Jim Hefferon (It really is free. You have to move the slider to zero and check out with a free purchase.)
