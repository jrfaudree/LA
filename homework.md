### HW 1 Hints

Many of the problems in this set rely on Section 1.4. and the operation $a^T b$.

You will need notation for building vectors from other vectors; see Section 1.1  In particular, the notations $0_n$, $\mathbf{1}_n$ for vectors of zeros and ones
will be handy. You will also need subvector notation $$a_{j:k}$$ and
stacking notation, either $(a,b,c)$ or 
\\[\begin{bmatrix}a\cr b\cr c\end{bmatrix}.\\]
