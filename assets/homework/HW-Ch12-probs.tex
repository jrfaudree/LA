    \problem Text 12.2 Modified.  Suppose that the $m\times n$ matrix $Q$
    has orthonormal columns, say $q_1,q_2, \cdots, q_n.$
    \begin{subproblems}
        \item Why do you immediately know that $m\ge n$ and hence $Q$ is tall or square?
        \item Suppose that $b$ is an $m$-vector. Show that $\hat x = Q^T b$ is the vector that minimizes $J(x)=||Qx-b||^2$. \textbf{Do this by setting up the normal equations directly.}
        \item Rewrite your solution for $\hat x$ in part $b$ \textbf{in terms of the columns of $Q$}. It will be helpful to write $b=(b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_m).$ You should now be able to complete the sentence below using the words ``inner product...".\\
        \begin{quote} If the columns of $Q$ are orthonormal, then the least squares approximation $\hat x$ for the system $Qx=b$ is ... \end{quote}
    \end{subproblems}

    \problem Supplemental \textbf{12.6}  Hint: Your matrix $A$ will be $6 \times 4$ and will have a lot of 0's and 1's. 

    \problem Suppose we want to compute the coefficients of 
    the quadratic $p(t) = c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2$ that is
    the least squares fit to the following $(t,y)$ data points:
    $(0,0)$, $(1, 8)$, $(3,8)$, $(4,20)$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Formulate the problem in the form of $Ac = b$.
        That is, find the matrix $A$ and the vector $b$.  You don't need
        to solve this system.
        \item Now formulate the normal equation $A^T A c = A^T b$
        that you would use to find these best-fit coefficients. Again,
        do not solve the system. (But don't worry, there is a Julia problem that tackles this!)
    \end{enumerate}
     
    \problem Text: problem 12.4.  Hint: you will find that the square roots of the weights
    are important and note that the weights are \emph{positive}. For part (b), remember that the columns of $C$ are linearly independent
    if and only if the only solution of $Cx=0$ is $x=0$.
