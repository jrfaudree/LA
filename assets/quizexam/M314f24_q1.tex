This quiz is worth 10 points.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (6 points) Let $\alpha=3$, $u=(1,2,3)$ and $v=(2,0,-1).$ Calculate each expression below. (Suppose $\textbf{1}$ is a 3-vector of all 1's.

	\begin{tabular}{lll}
	
	(a) $u+\textbf{1}$ \hspace{1in} &
	(b) $\textbf{1}^Tu$  \hspace{1in} &
	(c) $(\alpha u)^Tv.$
	\end{tabular}

\item (2 points) Suppose a course is graded based on five chapter tests and one final exam, each out of 100 points. The total course score in the class, $s,$ is calculated as weighted average where the chapter tests are worth 60\% of the grade and the final exam score is worth the remaining 40\% of the grade. The record for each student is given by a 6-vector $r$ where $r_1, r_2,r_3,r_4,$ and $r_5$ are the chapter test scores and $r_6$ is the final exam score.\\

Find a vector $w$ such that the  $s$ in the form $s=w^T r$ and $s$ is a number from 0 to 100.\\

\item (2 points) Let $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ be a 5-vector.\\
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the vector $d=x_{2:5}-x_{1:4}.$ (Note that your answer will have $x_i$'s in it.)\\
	\vfill
	
	\item Suppose that $x$ gives the price of a particular stock, in dollars per share, at the end of each day for the previous week (ie Mon - Fri). What does the vector $d$ represent for this stock? (One or two sentences is sufficient.)
