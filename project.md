Information about the project will be posted here. 


All students will pick a graph theoretic topic to explore in more detail and present the topic to the class. The oral
presentations are scheduled for the last week of class. (See the Weekly Schedule.) At least several days before the oral presentation, students
will submit a written paper on their topic to all members of the class. Thus, the audience can read about the topic in advance
and the speaker can give a more in-depth, less superficial, talk on the topic.

## Timeline

- (Oct 27) Pick a topic and some resources
- (Nov 30) Submit a paper to the class
- (Dec 1, Dec 4, or Dec 6) Give a 30 presentation to the class
- (Dec 15) Submit the final version of your paper

## Project Ideas and Sources

- Learn about an open problem
  - [open problems hosted by Robert Hockberg](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~hochberg/undopen/graphtheory/graphtheory.html)
  - [open problems hosted by Doug West](https://dwest.web.illinois.edu/openp/)
  - [open problem garden](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/category/graph_theory)
  - some classical problems to google: the reconstruction conjecture, graceful tree conjecture, overfull conjecture and 1-factorization conjecture, cycle double cover conjecture, strong perfect graph conjecture
 

- Read a published paper in graph theory
  - [mathscinet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/publications-search)

- Pick a topic from our text or another that we are not going to cover. Some other texts to consider are below:
  - Introduction to Graph Theory by Doug West
  - Graphs and Digraphs by Chartrand, Lesniak, Zhang
  - Modern Graph Theory by Bela Bollobas
  - Erdos on Graphs: His Legacy of Unsolved Problems by Chung and Graham
